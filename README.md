Introduction
This microservices system is designed to provide a scalable and modular architecture for a banking application. It leverages the Spring Boot framework for building robust backend services and Flask for machine learning capabilities, specifically in the treatment and detection of fake transactions.

Features
Microservices Architecture: The system is divided into independent microservices, allowing for scalability, maintainability, and easy deployment.

Spring Boot Backend: Backend services are implemented using Spring Boot, providing a Java-based, convention-over-configuration, opinionated framework.

Flask for Machine Learning: Flask is used to implement machine learning treatments for transaction data, enabling the system to analyze and process data efficiently.

Fake Transaction Detection: The system includes mechanisms for detecting fake transactions using machine learning models, enhancing the security of the banking application.
